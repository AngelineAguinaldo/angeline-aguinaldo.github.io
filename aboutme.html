											<h3>Education</h3>
											<p>I am an undergraduate student at <a href="http://drexel.edu/"><b>Drexel University</b></a> in Philadelphia, PA. I will be graduating from an Accelerated <b>Master of Science in Electrical Engineering</b>/<b>Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering</b> 5-Year Degree Program in <b>June 2017</b>. I will also be graduating with a graduate-level certificate in Engineering Management.</p>
											<p>I attended high school at the Academy of Allied Health Sciences in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.</p>
											<p>I am interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in the area of automated image analysis and computer vision.</p>

											<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
											<p>I like to dabble in a lot of random interests of which include, but are not limited to: photography, ukelele, piano, fitness training, film-making, basketball, online thrift selling, musical theater, theological history, video-editing, singing, homelessness advocacy programs, learning computer programming languages, designing image analysis algorithms, making PowerPoint presentations, watching YouTube videos, organizing and formating documents, improving computer folder structures,  etc.</p>
											<p>However, it can be probably be said that there are few unifying aspects that bridge these pastimes together:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Critical thinking. Because why not? Everyone loves a challenge.</li>
												<li>Creative thinking. I am all for freedom of expression which makes creative thinking a must!</li>
												<li>Visualization. Because for some reason, the things I'm really-super-good at involve images, diagrams, and/or making things "look good".</li>
												<li>Self-improvement. A natural by-product of trying new things (which is probably why my list is so extensive and all over the place).</li>

						<h3>A few thoughts</h3>
						<p>I decided to make this website to showcase (and remind myself of) all the incredible learning experiences I've had over my college career. I've had a lot of opportunities to maximize my education mainly due to the help of my advisors, mentors, friends, and family, so <i>thank you</i>. I intend on maintaining this website with any new projects, publications, thoughts, and achievements, so be sure to check back. I'm happy you came to visit!</p>

									<!-- <p>I have learned a great deal about my strengths, weaknesses, passions, and I-thought-I-liked-this-but-I-hate-it things. For example, I have discovered that I have a keen personal interest in helping people achieve their goals, primarily through professional development. On the side, I assist others enhance their resume and career profile which has resulted in successful job acquisition stories. One of my personal goals is to start a homelessness advocacy program in Philadelphia, PA that provides resume and career services to shelters across the city.</p>
									<p> I have also discovered that I am extremely passionate about finding truths about our universe. This has led me to discover the power of science in this endeavor. Science has given us the ability to guess-and-check every question we have from the pico-scopic to giga-scopic level. Research has shown me how easy it is to find problems that will impact millions of lives: They're everywhere!</p> -->
