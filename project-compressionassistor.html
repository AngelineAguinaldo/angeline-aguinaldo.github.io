									<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving technique that can be improved. The procedure alone is unlikely to restart the heart. To improve the technique and increase its potential to save lives, the team designed a device that measures the depth of CPR compressions given by a first responder in real time and outputs that depth onto a monitor. To measure the compression depth, the device includes an accelerometer that measures the acceleration of each compression. The device uses this value to calculate the displacement of the chest and outputs the result on a monitor. With this device’s feedback, the responder will be able to perform CPR ideally according to medical standards, increasing the likelihood of survival for the patient.</p>
									<p>The major tasks of the project included programming the microcontroller, creating the prototype design, and configuring the graphical user interface (GUI) to output the measurements (depth, number of compressions, time). A fully functional prototype with the output displayed on an external laptop monitor was produced.</p>
									<p>The use of an accelerometer as the primary sensor for this device contributed to the accuracy of displacement values being displayed on the GUI. This device possesses about a 2.91% error when the sensor acceleration is compared to measured acceleration. </p>

									<h2>What is <i>good</i> CPR?</h2>
									<p>Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) involves a combination of rescue breathing and chest compressions that contract the ventricles of the heart to keep blood flowing throughout the body and sustain oxygenation to the brain until a more definitive medical treatment can be provided to restore normal heart activity. See Figure 1 to visualize how a responder would perform chest compressions. The procedure this group will be referencing to is the American Red Cross Standard Guidelines for First Aid/CPR/AED response <sup>[1]</sup>. According to these guidelines, the chest compressions must meet certain conditions in order to be effective and increase the survival rate of the patient. The depth of the chest compressions must be + 2 inches for an adult, + 1.5 inches for a child, and + 0.5 inches for an infant <sup>[1]</sup>. They must also be performed at a rate of 100 compressions per minute including the 2 rescues breaths given after every 30 compressions <sup>[1]</sup>. It is very likely that although these standards are emphasized in CPR training and certification, they are not met when on site of a cardiac emergency. The accuracy and efficiency of CPR is often compromised due to lack of feedback during the procedure. With inaccurate CPR technique, chances of survival fall 7-10% every minute defibrillation is delayed <sup>[2]</sup>. Therefore, this group developed a device that is able to provide real time feedback to a medical responder on site so that CPR performance is optimized thus resulting in an overall increase in survival rate.</p>

									<h2> Existing Solutions </h2>
									<p>Based on the American Red Cross CPR certification requirements, a majority of responders are trained to perform manual CPR and gauge their performance through estimation. However, human error is ever-present with any manual procedure. Devices have been manufactured to measure compression depth and rate; however, medical responders currently lack these CPR assisting devices because of the costly nature of the product. Therefore, a cost-efficient device that measures CPR compression depth is greatly needed.</p>

									<h2>What did we come up with?</h2>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Compression Assistor/prototype with arduino full.jpg" alt="" /></span>The final deliverable is the Compression Assistor prototype. This includes the implementation of the glove that mounts the accelerometer, an ADXL335 Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout, MATLAB interfaced with the Arduino I/O Package, and a microcontroller attached to a laptop. The laptop displays the depth and rate of compressions.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Compression Assistor/lr prototype.png" alt="" /></span>The glove design has a universal aspect that allows both left- and right-handed users to use the device. Holes were cut on both sides of the glove to allow for this versatility. Additionally, fingerless tips were employed to allow easy access to bare fingers or latex gloved fingers. This convenience is important during patient care because there may be several other medical interventions that need to be performed simultaneously that require this functionality of the Compression Assistor.</p>

									<p> The Compression Assistor includes a program that has a toggle button in order to run the code and, upon running the code, the program collects the acceleration imposed on the accelerometer and determines displacement from the acceleration data collected. After the toggle button is switch to “off”, the timer is stopped and a pop-up dialog displays the compression rate in compressions per minute. The following diagram displays the signal flow in the Compression Assistor. </p>

									<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Compression Assistor/compression assistor flow diagram.png" alt=""/></center></span>
									<center><h5>Signal flow in the Compression Assistor software program</h5></center>

									<p>The “iomega” function is the most critical part of the Compression Assistor program because it is the function that converts acceleration to displacement. “The script takes an array of waveform data (datain), transforms [the array] into the frequency-domain in order to more easily convert [the array] into [the] desired output form” <sup>[3]</sup>. It implements the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the inverse Fast Fourier transform algorithms to shift between the time domain and the frequency domain. A sample of the iomega MATLAB script has been provided:
<pre><code>%   Transform datain into frequency domain via FFT and shift output (A)
%   so that zero-frequency amplitude is in the middle of the array 
%   (instead of the beginning)
A = fft(datain);
A = fftshift(A);
%   Convert datain of type datain_type to type dataout_type
for j = 1 : N
    if iomega_array(j) ~= 0
        A(j) = A(j) * (iomega_array(j) ^ iomega_exp);
    else
        A(j) = complex(0.0,0.0);
    end
end
%   Shift new frequency-amplitude array back to MATLAB format and
%   transform back into the time domain via the inverse FFT.
A = ifftshift(A);
datain = ifft(A);    
%   Remove zeros that were added to datain in order to pad to next
%   biggerst power of 2 and return dataout.
if size1 > size2
    dataout = real(datain(1:size1,size2));
else
    dataout = real(datain(size1,1:size2));
end
</code></pre>
									<p>As the code runs, a graphic user interface (GUI) is displayed to the responder. The GUI displays the depth of the compressions and the duration of the procedure. It also has been aesthetically enhanced to ensure the brand messaging of the company is visible to all of the device’s users.</p>

									<center><h5>Compression Assistor Graphic User Interface</h5></center> 

									<p> After hitting the toggle “Run” button to stop the program, the Compression Assistor displays a pop-up dialog box that informs the user how many compressions were performed per minute, aforementioned, namely the rate of compressions. See figure below for the dialog box.</p>

									<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Compression Assistor/compression assistor pop up dialog.png" alt=""/></center></span>
									<center><h5>Compression Assistor pop-up dialog box</h5></center> 

									<h2>Validation Testing</h2>
									<p>Experimental testing was conducted using VideoPoint Physics Fundamental. This is software that is able to measure the acceleration and displacement of an object in a video. The actual acceleration and displacement of the accelerometer were measured by VideoPoint Physics Fundamental, and those results were compared to the values being displayed on the laptop by the Compression Assistor. </p>
									<p>It was anticipated that the acceleration would differ due to varying rescuers. More experienced rescuers are likely to induce a greater downward acceleration versus an inexperienced rescuer. Therefore, there is no average acceleration found during CPR. Despite this, however, the values of the displacement were expected to be within the range of 0.05 – 3.00 inches in depth.</p>
									<p>The following tables and figures depict the values assessed by the VideoPoint Physics Fundamental Software versus the values detected by the Compression Assistor. </p>

									<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Compression Assistor/graph of acceleration.png" alt=""/></center></span>
									<center><h5>Compression Assistor graph of acceleration imposed by CPR compressions conducted over 18 seconds (This data was collected during the experimental trial.)</h5></center> 

									<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Compression Assistor/acceleration from VideoPoint.png" alt=""/></center></span>
									<center><h5>Actual acceleration imposed on the ADXL335 Accelerometer during one isolated chest compression</h5></center> 

									<p>The experiment consisted of 6 trials in which one CPR compression each was performed to isolate the acceleration of that compression. The acceleration from each trial was recorded by the Compression Assistor in MATLAB and additionally analyzed by VideoPoint Capture. The data was compared to assess the average percent error.</p>
									<p>The overall percent error obtained was 2.91%.</p>

									<h2>Inferences from the Data</h2>
									<p>From this data, it can be inferred that the acceleration detected from the Compression Assistor has a 2.91% error when compared to the actual acceleration deduced from VideoPoint Capture. This percent is minute enough to determine accurate displacement imposed on the accelerometer theoretically. However, due to the nature of the ADXL335 Triple Axis Accelerometer, it is difficult to allow an accurate displacement to display after every iteration. The use of an accelerometer as the primary sensory for this device could possibly serve as a vice for the Compression Assistor. Some evidence was found to support this statement: </p>
									<blockquote>Numerical double integration of measured accelerations involves errors that must be carefully studied and minimized: time integration amplifies the low frequency components of the sign and any measurement error is significantly amplified</blockquote>
									<p>This was evident after implementing the GUI in the Compression Assistor. It was found that the initial values of displacement displayed were accurate, however, they exponentially declined in accuracy due to the continually growing shift in initial values. This forced the device away from the initially correct calibrated values. Therefore, the accuracy of the Compression Assistor to detect displacement was compromised. </p>
									<p>Another observation that was made was that the actual acceleration obtained from the VideoPoint Capture program is the general form of acceleration that should be maintained throughout the CPR procedure. The graph displayed above can be identified as the signature form of a single chest compression. This information can be further analyzed to obtain a better understanding of an accurate chest compression and in turn train responders to mimic this form when performing the procedure in the future.</p>

									<h2>Design Improvements</h2>
									<p>The Compression Assistor, like any device, could always be improved. The glove that mounts the accelerometer, while providing the necessary functions in this prototype, does not hone the necessary durability. Water-resistant fabric could be used in manufacturing to allow for a longer lifespan. Additionally, the accelerometer case used in this prototype requires delicate handling of the device. A more protective encasement for the accelerometer could also be designed to ensure maximum durability. </p>
									<p>The accuracy of the device, which is currently not at optimal precision, can be improved to achieve an even smaller percent error in regards to acceleration. Additional device remodeling and alternative testing can be conducted to ensure an increase in accuracy. As mentioned previously, a new sensor may need to be employed in order to receive more accurate data. A reassessment of the code could also result in an increased accuracy of the device such that the code could account for three-dimensional movements of the hand as opposed to programming the Compression Assistor to gather data from solely one axis, e.g. z-axis. </p>
									<p>The code could also be improved to provide a continually updating rate of compressions so that the responder could receive feedback about his or her rate of compression much sooner than after every 30 compressions. </p>
									<p>It is anticipated with further research and development that the Compression Assistor could be made portable and stand-alone. This requires further investigation on how to configure a stand-alone LCD monitor. Currently, the accelerometer and microcontroller is powered by the laptop that it is attached to; therefore, a portable Compression Assistor would require supplementary materials such as a portable power supply and a larger casing.</p>
									<p>The Compression Assistor could also enhance the type of feedback provided to the responder. For instance, as opposed to simply collecting data during the procedure with respect to acceleration and displacement, it could also collect data with respect to pressure and sound. This design would require additional sensors such as a microphone and a pressure sensor to be implemented into the device. This would provide an even greater quantity of feedback to the medical responder. </p>

									<h2>Expanding the Device</h2>
									<p>The Compression Assistor is simply the initial piece to a larger, more complex CPR assisting device. If provided additional time, resources, and a larger budget, the Compression Assistor can be implemented into a CPR device that is able to perform chest compressions on its own, namely a previously envisioned bio-sensing device called the Automated Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (A-CPR) Device. This would perform the necessary compressions for CPR for the medical responder. The implementation of the Compression Assistor into the A-CPR device would allow the device to gauge the depth of its automatic compressions and adjust accordingly. Similarly, the A-CPR device would also increase the survival rate from cardiac arrest by minimizing injury and providing consistent compressions thus improving the accuracy of CPR.</p>
